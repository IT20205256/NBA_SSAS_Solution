This project is based on Data Warehousing which explains the ETL process of a database. In here, I have used the MS-SQL server as the main technology to implement the major part.</br> 
As a better explanation, I have created a simple database an inputted the datasets inside them. Then, I have have extracted them to the <b>STAGING AREA</b> and atlast I have transformed and Loaded into the Data warehouse. </br>

So, to execute this tasks I have used some technologies which are given below:

      1. To main the DB, staging area and Datawarehouse -> SSMS
      2. To created the pipelines                       -> SSIS
